# sports-search-engine

Sports Search Engine is a console program that searches the rushing and receiving stats for the 2015 Eagles.

The information is stored as a csv in stats.csv.  pop_db.py converts the csv file and converts into into a database.

by_player.ps is the main file for the program.  The program allows you to search by player name, age, and position and then it will return the players' stats or the names of the players that match the users queries. The program also allows the user to create a new player and add them to the database.
